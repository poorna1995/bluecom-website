Purchase order management involves several states that help track the status of purchase orders.Â  From creating and tracking purchase orders to ensuring timely and accurate delivery, this process can be complex and time-consuming. We will explore the different states of purchase order management

 1. **Worksheet:** The worksheet state is the initial stage of a purchase order. At this stage, the purchase order is created, but it has not been approved or submitted for processing. In this state, the purchase order can be edited, and changes can be made before it is submitted for approval.
 2. **Active:** Once the purchase order is approved and submitted for processing, it enters the active state. In this state, the purchase order is in effect, and the supplier can start processing and fulfilling the order. The purchase order can no longer be edited at this stage.
 3. **Partially Received:** When a supplier delivers only a portion of the ordered items, the purchase order enters the partially received state. In this state, the order is partially fulfilled, and the supplier is still responsible for delivering the remaining items. The purchase order can still be modified at this stage, such as increasing or decreasing the quantity of the remaining items.
 4. **Closed:** Once the supplier has fully delivered all the ordered items, the purchase order enters the closed state. At this stage, the purchase order is considered complete, and no further changes or modifications can be made to it. The order is closed in the company's system, and it is archived for future reference.
 5. **Cancelled:** If a purchase order is cancelled before it is fully received, it enters the cancelled state. In this state, the purchase order is considered null and void, and no further processing or delivery is expected. The purchase order can be cancelled for various reasons, such as incorrect item or quantity, supplier issues, budget constraints, or changes in project requirements.
