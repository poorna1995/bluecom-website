Managing product information is critical to ecommerce business success.  More importantly, for a multi-channel business.  Importance of maintaining consistent and accurate product information across all channels becomes paramount.

Some of the use cases look like :-

1. **Artifact differences :** The description for one channel may not be suitable for the other.   What works well in one marketplace may not be suitable for another. This requires you to have ability to manage multiple descriptions.

2. **Channel Compliance :**  When publishing products to channels, some channels have rules to compliance while you publish the products.

3. **Customer Experience :** Customers have various touch points while interacting with the product.  A customer finds your product in Marketplace A, and buys in Marketplace B.  In such scenarios, having a seamless product experience is pivotal for conversion.  This requires a single source of truth of all the product information data.  Ensuring that customers receive consistent and accurate information regardless of where they choose to shop.

4. **Productivity and Efficiency -**  ecommerce businesses need to automate many of the tasks involved in managing and distributing product information.  This enhances their productivity and less prone to errors
